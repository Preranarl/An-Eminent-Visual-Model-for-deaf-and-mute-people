### Introduction:
A gesture is a pattern that may be static, dynamic, or both, and is a form of nonverbal communication in which bodily motions convey information. Communication is an important aspect
when it comes to sharing or expressing information, and feelings, and it brings people closer to each other with better understanding When it comes to disabled persons for example deaf and dumb
people, it becomes tougher for them to communicate using natural language. So, they use sign language to communicate with themselves and with the entire world. But normal people find it difficult
to understand sign language as they do not have mostly any prior education or experience in this. Sign language is composed of visual gestures and signs, which are used by the deaf and mute for their
talking. It is a well-structured code gesture where every sign has a specific meaning allotted to it. These signs are not only used for alphabet or numeric but for common expressions also for example greetings
and sentences. There are 143 existing different sign languages all over the world. Every country has its language, similarly, sign language is not a universal language and differs from country to country. There has been a lot of work already done on ASLrecognition as it is a widely learned language all
over the globe. ASL uses a single hand in the gesture representation and it is simple compared to ISL. ISL uses both hands for gesture representation and it is complex compared to ASL. Because of this reason, there is less research and development in this field. This project's goal is to take the simple step
of connecting the social and communication bridge between regular people and disabled people with the help of Indian Sign Language. As per research made various projects until now only deal with 
alphabets and numeric in ISL, but we are extended it to common actions which can be more effective for disabled and normal people in communication and understanding. As we live in a century
where India is developing at a rapid pace in terms of digital and technological advances, this project could be one of the stepping stones where technology meets humanity and help the hearing impaired
and mute community. The project uses an image processing system to identify sign language used by deaf people to communicate and converts them into text so that normal people can understand. And
also it uses speech recognition to convert the voice of normal people and converts them into text so that
normal people can understand.

### Methodology:
(a) Hand gesture to text :
Three components are required to construct a Hand Gesture Recognition system:
1) The sample data set is given.
2)  Create a model (In this case we will use a CNN).
3)  A platform on which to implement our model (We are going to use OpenCV) and display the text. (b) Speech to text :
Three components are required to construct a Speech Recognition system:
1) With the help of a microphone, audio input is given to the system.
2) Convert analog signals to digital signals and then break the words into phonemes.
3) Compare the phonemes with words in its built-in dictionary and display the text.

### Future Scope:
The proposed sign language recognition system used to recognize sign language letters, digits, and hand gestures can be further extended to recognize facial expressions. 
This also increases readability. The scope of different sign languages can be increased. More training data can be added to detect the letter with more accuracy. This project can further be
extended to convert speech into signs. This project can further be extended to convert the speech of normal people to sign because normal people do not always know about the sign languages of deaf
and mute people. So it can further be extended to convert the speech into signs

### Conclusion :
The sensor less sign language and gesture recognition system is a module which provides an easy and satisfactory user communication for deaf and dumb people. The module provides two way
communications which helps in easy interaction between the normal people and disables. The system is novel approach to ease the difficulty in communicating with those having speech and vocal disabilities. The aim is to provide an application to the society to establish the ease of communication between the
deaf and mute people by making use of image and speech processing algorithm. Since it follows an image and speech based approach it can be launched as an application in any minimal system ,hence
has near zero-cost. Hence our system/model is a combination of two different systems i.e hand gesture and speech recognition systems
